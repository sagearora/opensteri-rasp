# Printer Management System

A comprehensive Node.js application for managing GoDEX printers and label printing functionality using environment-based authentication. This system provides printer authentication, real-time command processing, and automated label printing without requiring a REST API.

## üöÄ Features

- **Environment Authentication**: Uses environment file with printer_id and join token for authentication
- **Printer Authentication**: Secure printer joining with token-based authentication
- **Real-time Commands**: WebSocket-based command processing from GraphQL backend
- **Label Printing**: Automated label generation and printing with QR codes
- **Hardware Integration**: Direct USB communication with GoDEX printers
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Periodic status updates to maintain printer online status
- **Environment Configuration**: Boot-time environment file creation with authentication data
- **Archived Printer Monitoring**: Automatic cleanup when printer is archived (archived_at field)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- GoDEX printer (vendor ID: 6495, product ID: 1)
- Raspberry Pi (recommended) or Linux system with USB support
- sudo privileges for USB operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pi-opensteri
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.config` file in the project root:
   ```env
   # GraphQL Configuration
   HASURA_GRAPHQL_WS=wss://your-hasura-instance.hasura.app/v1/graphql
   HASURA_GRAPHQL_URL=https://your-hasura-instance.hasura.app/v1/graphql
   
   # Heartbeat Configuration
   HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60
   ```

4. **Install system dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install USB development libraries
   sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
   ```

5. **Setup environment authentication**
   The system expects a `.env` file to be created on boot with:
   ```env
   PRINTER_ID=your-printer-id
   PRINTER_JOIN_TOKEN=your-join-token
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Services

- **`src/index.ts`**: Main application entry point
- **`src/services/`**: Business logic services

### Service Layer

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `printerConnectionService.ts` | Printer connection initialization and management |
| `printerService.ts` | High-level printer operations (join, print, status) |
| `checkPrinter.ts` | Low-level USB communication with GoDEX printers |
| `environmentAuth.ts` | Environment-based authentication management |
| `graphqlClient.ts` | GraphQL WebSocket and HTTP client management |
| `fetchPrinterInfo.ts` | Printer information retrieval from backend |
| `handleCommand.ts` | Incoming command processing and execution |
| `startHeartbeat.ts` | Periodic status updates to backend |
| `subscribePrinter.ts` | Real-time printer monitoring with archived_at watching |

## üöÄ Usage

### Environment Authentication

The system uses environment-based authentication. On boot, a `.env` file should be created with:

```env
PRINTER_ID=your-printer-id
PRINTER_JOIN_TOKEN=your-join-token
```

The system will automatically:
1. Load the authentication data from the environment file
2. Authenticate using the join token to get an access token
3. Establish GraphQL connections for real-time communication
4. Set up printer monitoring with archived_at field watching
5. Set up command subscriptions and heartbeat monitoring

### Label Printing

The system automatically processes print commands received through the GraphQL subscription system. No manual API calls are needed.

### Printer Status

The system automatically monitors printer status and maintains heartbeat connections to keep the printer online.

### Archived Printer Handling

When a printer's `archived_at` field is set to a non-null value, the system automatically:

1. **Stops heartbeat monitoring** - Prevents further status updates
2. **Clears environment variables** - Removes `PRINTER_ID` and `PRINTER_JOIN_TOKEN` from `.env` file
3. **Disconnects subscriptions** - Stops all GraphQL subscriptions
4. **Logs cleanup actions** - Provides detailed logging of cleanup operations

This ensures that archived printers are properly disconnected and the system is ready for new printer configurations.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HASURA_GRAPHQL_WS` | WebSocket URL for GraphQL subscriptions | Required |
| `HASURA_GRAPHQL_URL` | HTTP URL for GraphQL queries | Required |
| `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Heartbeat interval in seconds | `60` |

### Authentication Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Source |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PRINTER_ID` | Unique printer identifier | Created on boot |
| `PRINTER_JOIN_TOKEN` | Authentication token for printer joining | Created on boot |

### Printer Configuration

The system is configured for GoDEX printers with:
- **Vendor ID**: 6495
- **Product ID**: 1
- **USB Interface**: 0
- **Endpoint**: Output endpoint for command transmission

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Printer not detected**
   - Ensure GoDEX printer is connected via USB
   - Check USB permissions: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`
   - Verify printer vendor/product IDs match configuration

2. **Authentication fails**
   - Ensure `.env` file exists with `PRINTER_ID` and `PRINTER_JOIN_TOKEN`
   - Verify the join token is valid and not expired
   - Check that the printer ID matches the expected format

3. **GraphQL connection errors**
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Check network connectivity to Hasura instance
   - Ensure authentication tokens are valid

4. **Permission denied errors**
   - Run with sudo for USB operations
   - Add user to appropriate groups: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`

5. **Archived printer not cleaning up**
   - Check that the `archived_at` field is properly set in the database
   - Verify GraphQL subscription is receiving updates
   - Check logs for cleanup operation details

### Logs

The application provides detailed logging for debugging:
- Authentication status updates
- Connection status updates
- Command processing logs
- Error details with stack traces
- Heartbeat and subscription status
- Archived printer cleanup operations

## üîí Security

- **Environment Authentication**: Authentication data is loaded from environment file
- **USB Security**: Direct USB communication with hardware validation
- **API Security**: Bearer token authentication for GraphQL operations
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Archived printers are automatically disconnected and cleaned up

### Key Features

#### Archived Printer Monitoring

The system now includes comprehensive monitoring of the `archived_at` field:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: GraphQL subscription watches for changes to `archived_at`
- **Automatic Cleanup**: When `archived_at` is set, the system automatically:
  - Stops heartbeat monitoring
  - Clears environment authentication data
  - Disconnects all subscriptions
  - Logs cleanup operations
- **Graceful Handling**: Cleanup operations are performed safely without affecting other system components

#### Updated GraphQL Schema

The GraphQL schema has been updated to include:

```graphql
subscription watchPrinter($printerId: uuid!) {
  printer_by_pk(id: $printerId) {
    id
    clinic_id
    paired_at
    last_seen_at
    version_number
    update_started_at
    archived_at
    commands(where: {executed_at: {_is_null: true}}, order_by: {id: asc}, limit: 1) {
      id
      created_at
      printer_id
      command
      data
      executed_at
    }
  }
}
```

This allows the system to monitor the entire printer object and handle commands within the printer subscription.
